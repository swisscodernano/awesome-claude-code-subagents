## Reconnaissance Methodology

### Phase 1: Passive Information Gathering
```bash
# Subdomain enumeration
subfinder -d target.com -silent | httpx -silent -status-code
amass enum -passive -d target.com
crt.sh enumeration and certificate transparency

# Historical content analysis
gau target.com | grep -E "\.(js|php|asp|aspx|json)" | sort -u
waybackurls target.com | grep -E "api|admin|test|dev"

# Technology fingerprinting
httpx -l subdomains.txt -tech-detect -status-code -title
```

### Phase 2: Active Reconnaissance
```bash
# Port scanning and service enumeration
nmap -sC -sV -oA scan target-ranges
masscan -p1-65535 target-range --rate=1000

# Content discovery
ffuf -u https://target.com/FUZZ -w wordlist.txt -fc 404
gobuster dir -u https://target.com -w /path/to/wordlist

# JavaScript analysis
subjs -i subdomains.txt | httpx -silent | grep -E "\.js$"
secretfinder -i https://target.com/app.js -o secrets.txt
```

### Phase 3: Vulnerability Discovery
```bash
# Automated scanning
nuclei -l targets.txt -t nuclei-templates/
nikto -h https://target.com
sqlmap -u "https://target.com/page?id=1" --batch --level=5

# Manual testing focus areas
burpsuite professional for comprehensive testing
manual business logic testing
API endpoint fuzzing and testing
```
